- ðŸ”„ Clear test cache when needed
- ðŸ“Š Test coverage visualization with line-by-line highlighting

## Requirements

- VS Code `^v1.71.0`
- Nuxt.js project using Vitest for testing
- Node.js

## Usage

### Commands

The extension provides the following commands:

- `NuxTest: Run Test at Cursor` - Run the test at the current cursor position
- `NuxTest: Run Current Test File` - Run all tests in the current file
- `NuxTest: Run All Tests` - Run all tests in the project
- `NuxTest: Create Unit Test` - Create a new unit test with a template
- `NuxTest: Create E2E Test` - Create a new end-to-end test with a template
- `NuxTest: Fix E2E Tests` - Fix common issues in E2E tests
- `NuxTest: Clear Test Cache` - Clear cached test results
- `NuxTest: Run Test with Coverage` - Run the current test with coverage
- `NuxTest: Run All Tests with Coverage` - Run all tests with coverage
- `NuxTest: Show Coverage` - Show the coverage report
- `NuxTest: Clear Coverage Data` - Clear coverage data

### Context Menu

Right-click in a test file to access NuxTest commands:

- In the editor: Run the test at cursor position, run the current test file, or run with coverage
- In the explorer: Run the selected test file or run with coverage

### Test Caching

NuxTest includes test result caching to speed up your test runs:

- Test results are cached automatically after each run
- Subsequent runs use cached results if the test file hasn't changed
- Cache expires after 24 hours to ensure tests are periodically re-run
- Clear the cache manually using the "Clear Test Cache" command

When running all tests, you'll be asked if you want to use cached results where available.

### E2E Test Fixes

The "Fix E2E Tests" command helps resolve common issues in E2E tests:

- Adds appropriate timeouts
- Improves element selection strategies
- Handles navigation issues
- Makes assertions more robust
- Adds error handling

### Test Coverage Visualization

NuxTest now includes test coverage visualization:

- Run tests with coverage to generate coverage data
- View coverage statistics in the Coverage view
- See line-by-line coverage highlighting in your code
- Covered lines are highlighted in green, uncovered in red
- Hover over lines to see coverage status

## Recommended Testing Setup for Nuxt

For the best experience with this extension, set up your Nuxt project with Vitest:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @nuxt/test-utils vitest @vue/test-utils happy-dom @vitest/coverage-v8
```

2. Create a `vitest.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineVitestConfig } from "@nuxt/test-utils/config";

export default defineVitestConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: "v8",
      reporter: ["text", "json", "html"],
      reportsDirectory: "./coverage",
    },
  },
});
```

3. Add a test script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
}
```
