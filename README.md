## Context Menu

Right-click in a test file to access NuxTest commands:

- In the editor: Run or debug the test at cursor position, run the current test file, or run with coverage
- In the explorer: Run or debug the selected test file or run with coverage

### Test Debugging

NuxTest provides integrated debugging for your tests:

- Debug a specific test at the cursor position
- Debug all tests in a file
- Debug all tests in the project
- Automatically creates and updates VS Code launch configurations
- Checks for required dependencies and offers to install them if missing
- Provides a seamless debugging experience with breakpoints, variable inspection, and more

### Test History and Trends

NuxTest now includes test history and trends tracking:

- Automatically records test results in a local database
- View test run history with pass/fail status and duration
- Identify flaky tests that alternate between passing and failing
- See trends in test performance over time
- Visualize pass rates and stability metrics for each test
- Quickly navigate to problematic tests that need attention

The Test History & Trends view categorizes tests as:

- **Flaky**: Tests that frequently alternate between passing and failing
- **Unstable**: Tests with low pass rates
- **Mostly Stable**: Tests that pass most of the time but occasionally fail
- **Stable**: Tests that consistently pass

### Test Caching

NuxTest includes test result caching to speed up your test runs:

- Test results are cached automatically after each run
- Subsequent runs use cached results if the test file hasn't changed
- Cache expires after 24 hours to ensure tests are periodically re-run
- Clear the cache manually using the "Clear Test Cache" command

When running all tests, you'll be asked if you want to use cached results where available.

### E2E Test Fixes

The "Fix E2E Tests" command helps resolve common issues in E2E tests:

- Adds appropriate timeouts
- Improves element selection strategies
- Handles navigation issues
- Makes assertions more robust
- Adds error handling

### Test Coverage Visualization

NuxTest now includes test coverage visualization:

- Run tests with coverage to generate coverage data
- View coverage statistics in the Coverage view
- See line-by-line coverage highlighting in your code
- Covered lines are highlighted in green, uncovered in red
- Hover over lines to see coverage status

## Test Organization and Filtering

The Test Organization feature helps you manage large test suites by providing:

- **Tags**: Categorize tests with tags like "unit", "e2e", "component", etc.
- **Filters**: Filter tests by tags, status, duration, and more
- **Grouping**: Group tests by tag, status, feature/component, or custom category
- **Filter Presets**: Save filter configurations for quick access

### Using Tags

Tags help you categorize your tests:

1. Right-click on a test in the Test Explorer and select `Add Tag to Test`
2. Select from existing tags or create a new one
3. Use tags to filter and organize your tests

The system automatically detects and applies some tags based on test content and location:

- Tests in e2e folders get the "E2E" tag
- Tests using Vue Test Utils get the "Component" tag
- Tests in unit folders get the "Unit" tag

### Creating Custom Filters

Create custom filter presets to quickly access specific test subsets:

1. In the Test Organization view, click the "Create Filter Preset" button
2. Enter a name for your filter
3. Configure filter criteria (tags, status, duration, etc.)
4. Save the filter preset for future use

### Grouping Tests

Group tests by different criteria to better understand your test suite:

- **Tag**: Group tests by their tags
- **Status**: Group tests by their status (passed, failed, etc.)
- **Feature/Component**: Group tests by the feature or component they test
- **Category**: Group tests by custom categories

## Requirements

- VS Code `^v1.71.0`
- Nuxt.js project using Vitest for testing
- Node.js

## Extension Settings

This extension doesn't require any specific settings.

## Recommended Testing Setup for Nuxt

For the best experience with this extension, set up your Nuxt project with Vitest:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @nuxt/test-utils vitest @vue/test-utils happy-dom @vitest/coverage-v8
```

2. Create a `vitest.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineVitestConfig } from "@nuxt/test-utils/config";

export default defineVitestConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: "v8",
      reporter: ["text", "json", "html"],
      reportsDirectory: "./coverage",
    },
  },
});
```

3. Add a test script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
}
```

## Component Preview

The Component Preview feature allows you to preview Vue components directly in VSCode. This is useful for:

- Quickly checking how a component looks without running the entire application
- Testing component appearance with different props and state
- Verifying component styling and layout

To use the Component Preview feature:

1. Open a Vue component file (`.vue`)
2. Right-click in the editor and select `NuxTest: Show Component Preview`
3. A preview panel will open showing the rendered component

The preview updates automatically when you save changes to the component file.

## Known Issues

- Component preview may not fully support all Vue.js features and complex components
- Some advanced test configurations may require manual setup
